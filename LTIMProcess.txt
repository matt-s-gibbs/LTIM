Sequence:
ExportData.R - export data from Hydstra
ProcessData. R - converts hydstra output into MDMS output
AllData.R - converts hydstra data into format for MIKE conversion
Hydstra2dsf0.mzt - convert alldata.r output into dfs0 files.

Copy relevent files to relevent models.
Run models, make sure diversions and ewater are set to zero

Run modelling/PlotResults.R to compare model results of actual conditions to hydstra data and calculate diversions

Create diversion files, add to models and rerun to match flows.

Check model calibration (rerun model and PlotResults.R)

When happy, remove ewater.

Assessment/LTIMPlotResults.R to compare scenarios.
Assessment/MDMSOutput.R to output models results for MDMS.
